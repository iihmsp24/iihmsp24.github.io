            <p align="justify">
                Meta-heuristic Optimization Algorithms have been shown to be useful for the optimization of engineering applications. However, the computational complexity of the Meta-heuristic Optimization Algorithms cause the limitations for the real time applications of the engineering area. There are several research issues to improve the efficiency of the Meta-heuristic Optimization Algorithms including the hardware implementation and the application of the surrogate assisted models. This talk will focus on the introduction of Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithms for continuous, discrete, binary and categorical data optimization problems. The surrogate assisted optimization algorithms such as the surrogate assisted models selection, the combination of the Meta-heuristic Optimization Algorithm with the surrogate assisted models will be introduced. The three major branches of the surrogate assisted optimization algorithms, for example the sampling scheme, the simplified fitness function and the dimension decomposition will also be discussed.<br>

            <p align="justify">
                It is now evident that AI contributes radically new and extraordinary capabilities to the products, processes, and strategies of individuals, organizations, social entities and the broader economy. Corvinus University of Budapest has termed this phenomenon ``AI Transformation'' in 2023, recognising it as the next step in the evolution of digital transformation. One of the primary obstacles of AI Transformation is the lack of trustworthiness surrounding the key capabilities of AI solutions, which mostly stems from the lack of Provable AI outcomes. Therefore, the keynote presentation introduces a groundbreaking, fundamental methodology that offers mathematically provable evidence for the stability and performance of AI-driven control solutions, with the goal of replacing today's experience-based evaluations, which are insufficient in control design. The challenge in proving the stability and performance of AI controllers arises from their fundamentally different mathematical formulations of Neural Network compared to those used in modern system control analysis, (e.g. convex optimisation or Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) based methods). These mathematical formalism are rather incompatible. The keynote lecture will introduce a transformation methodology capable of transforming the Neural Network representation to an alternative representation that is very common in system control design and analysis.<br>

                Peter Baranyi was born in 1970 and earned his M.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Education in 1994. In 1999, he obtained his Ph.D. in Informatics. He defended his title of Doctor of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 2006. That same year, he was inducted as a member of the Hungarian Academy of Engineering. He held prestigious research positions abroad. Among these, he spent one year at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), one year - in total - at both Tokyo University and the Gifu Research Institute (Japan), and additional tenures at various esteemed universities in the UK, EU and Australia. He has published approximately 110 journal papers and four monographs with international scientific publishers that received about 9000 citations leading h-index 50. His research accomplishments have been recognized with 15 scientific awards. Notably, he received the Kimura Prize from the Asian Control Society, the Sigma Xi Award from the Canadian/International Group, the International Dennis Gabor Award, and the Bolyai Memorial Award. He invented the TP model transformation (in collaboration with Y. Yam), that, actually, defines a new concept, the higher-order singular value decomposition of continuous functions. This innovation plays a crucial role in nonlinear control design theories. It has been demonstrated that TP model transformation is a necessary additional step to Linear Matrix Inequality-based optimization (a key method in modern control theory) to achieve optimal solutions. Furthermore, it has opened ways to new concepts in nonlinear control design and optimization. In 2022, one of his paper about the TP model transfromation was highlighted as the advanced research of the month, selected from among seven IEEE Transactions journals (CIS).<br>

                “TO EARN TRUST, money and power aren't enough; you have to show some concern for others. You can't buy trust in the supermarket.” said His Holiness the Dalai Lama (Jaffe, 2018). A currency note (or money) issued by any central bank or king or monetary authority gains it value in the minds of the citizens or even the market traders based on the Trust - Promise it bears and the reputation the said country / central bank endows in it. Trust is a highly valuable asset that can either make or break. Trust is as fragile as Abstract Trust is an essential element of every relationship. It has the ability to create value from processes, products, services and relationships. The value is well placed in the financial system where we trust the governments and central banks. The entire financial system is based on trust which creates financial value for all. Similarly all function of the organisation whether marketing, finance, production, human resources are all based on the ability of the trust they generate with the stakeholders through their processes and the reflective learning people gain through their interactions. Trust can be built and can pay rich dividend in the form of higher sales, higher salaries, commitments of employees, partners, children, goodwill and others. One is willing to place a value financially to trust in terms of the premium one pays for the next best alternative. The study in a methodological method builds on Trust and its financial value well recognised but not acknowledged in the literature and teachings of life and management. The study explores how Trust can be build and changes over time. It also explores the mathematical experiments in defining trusts and provides for the means for valuation.<br>
